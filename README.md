# MK8 Voice Porter
Currently only for Mario Kart 8 on WiiU. Port BARS/BFWAV/~~WAV~~* files to work with other characters!

When using BFWAV or WAV files as your input, make sure to name your input files using the User-Friendly filenames.
MK8-Voice-Porter can also detect the filenames from any character on the WiiU version of the game 
which is useful for quick porting, however it may be more useful in that situation to just use 
the BARS conversion.

You can also use this tool to change the names of your files to the User-Friendly version for easier editing.

# First Time Setup
Download the latest version of MK8 Voice Porter
Click "Extract Params..."
In the first textbox, search for your content folder in your MK8 dump. For example, mine is "F:\AMKP\MARIO KART 8\content\"
In the second textbox, search for your content folder in your MK8 update dump. For example, mine is "F:\AMKP\MARIO KART 8 UPDATE v64\content\". This can be skipped if you're not going to be porting to or from DLC characters.
Click "Extract Params". The program will freeze for a moment. When it's unfrozen, close the Extract Params window.

# Using MK8 Voice Porter
Click "Input Folder", then put your .bars file or correctly named .bfwav/~~wav~~* files in the folder. A list of User-Friendly names can be found below, however any vanilla file name can also be used if that is your preference.
In the "Output Format" dropdown select format you want, generally this will be .bars.
In the "Output Driver" dropdown select the driver you would like to port over.
Click Port.
Click OK.
Click "Output Folder" to see the completed file. You can patch this in with whatever method you normally use to mod MK8 on console and on emulator.

\* Porting from WAV files has been removed until further notice.
