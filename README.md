# MK8-Voice-Porter
Currently only for Mario Kart 8 on WiiU. Port BARS/BFWAV/WAV files to work with other characters!

When using BFWAV or WAV files as your input, make sure to name your input files using the User-Friendly filenames.
MK8-Voice-Porter can also detect the filenames from any character on the WiiU version of the game 
which is useful for quick porting, however it may be more useful in that situation to just use 
the BARS conversion.

You can also use this tool to change the names of your files to the User-Friendly version for easier editing.

# How to Use
Place your BARS file or BFWAV/WAV files into the Input folder.
Choose the character you wish to port to.
Press "Port to BARS file".
The files can be found in the Output folder.
